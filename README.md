# Code examples for the Nordeas Open Banking API

This repo provides code examples for the Nordeas Open Banking API.

These examples show how to make API requests, so it is easier to get the idea how the API is meant to be used.

Note that the examples here are not production grade code so, e.g., error handling might not be complete.

## Examples

All of these individual examples generate new access token before they do their thing.

For more thorough information about concepts etc. please refer to the documentation found in developer portal.

## Languages

Currently we provide examples for python but we'll add more languages here. Please check readme files in the specific directories for more information.
