# Code examples for the Nordeas Open Banking API

This repo provides code examples for the Nordeas Open Banking API.

These examples show how to make API requests, so it is easier to get the idea how the API is meant to be used.

Note that the examples here are not production grade code so, e.g., error handling is not complete.
